**GOALS OF THE PROJECT Heart Failure Prediction**

1. Data exploration.

2. Creation of the most efficient classification model which enables us to detect the largest possible number of patients most at risk of heart failure.

3. Creation of a model-based, user-friendly, and giving instant predictions application supporting employees in the medical industry.

4. Development of deployment proposals and calculation of potential benefits for patients and profits for medical facilities resulting from the application implementation.


**Business concept**

By using our application, we help doctors in analyzing patient results. However, thanks to the data provided by customers working with our application, we are able to develop our product and increase its accuracy of prediction.

**Profits after implemention of app**

We can assume that the physician’s analysis of the patient’s test results and qualifying him to the appropriate risk group for death takes an average of 5 minutes during a 20-minute visit.
Using our application, we shorten this time to 1 minute while maintaining high accuracy of prediction and the same efficiency of work from the first to the last patient.
So in fact we save 4 minutes which is 20% of total visit time.

**Summary**

The implementation of the application will allow doctors to automate their work while maintaining high accuracy of predictions. 
The time saved will help increase the income of medical facilities, shorten the waiting time for the visit or extend the visit time for patients with a high probability of death, thanks to which it will be possible to save another human life.
