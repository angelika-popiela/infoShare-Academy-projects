CONCLUSIONS

Fossil fuels

Almost all countries recorded a decrease in energy consumption from fossil fuels, with the most spectacular drop — 27% — observed in Tajikistan. This decline is linked to the launch of efficient hydroelectric power networks, made possible by the country’s mountainous landscape (the Pamir ranges) and its third-largest per-capita water resources in the world. This will be confirmed on the next slide.

Renewable energy

The data shows how the former Soviet republics’ approach to renewable energy has evolved over time. The results correlate with the decline in fossil fuel usage. As mentioned, Tajikistan is leading this shift, followed closely by the Baltic states, which achieved nearly a 20% increase in renewable energy consumption as a share of gross final energy use. Two countries show stagnation in this area: Armenia and Kazakhstan.
Poland, due to its reliance on so-called “dirty energy sources” and limited diversification between 1992 and 2012, ranks in the middle with a 9% increase.

CO₂ emissions

Eleven out of the fourteen analysed countries reduced their CO₂ emissions over the span of 20 years. Interestingly, the Baltic states did not make it into the top three. At the bottom — in the least favourable positions — are Turkmenistan and Armenia, where emissions of this greenhouse gas increased dramatically (likely due to rising cement production).
Overall, the data clearly indicates a gradual energy transition and a shift towards greener, more environmentally friendly sources.
